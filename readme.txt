VERSION HISTORY


_Promod Reflex version 1.1a:
Tweaking weapon values to be in-line with their no attachment equivalents. 
Mod should fulfill the original mission of having fully playable red dots on weapons in CoD4 PromodLIVE 2.20.

In the future, red dots may be taken off some weapons for balance and it's even possible that other attachments like ACOGs, grips, shotgun red dots could be added to the mod. 
Right now I'm working on adding back some of the stock guns that were removed from the game by promod. The Skorpion and the Barrett are the first two I have been looking into and have them both working in promod, but not entirely playable in this version of the mod. 
Now trying to figure out how to balance them in the promod sandbox before finishing them.

(Secret Weapons???)
Barrett Notes-
Decreased magazine size from 10 --> 5
Increased firetime from .05 --> .925 (higher number = fires slower)
Testing heavily increased damage and recoil
Decreased movement speed from 1 --> .9
Increased reload cancel timing from 2.8 --> 3.8

Skorpion Notes-
Max dmg decreased from 50 --> 45
Min dmg decreased from 20 --> 17
Reload cancel time from 2.2 sec --> 1.7 sec
(maybe adjust limb damage if still too good?)

Farther future goals of adding sights used in campaign but not multiplayer, and the special M4 Carbine varieties and other unique weapons from the campaign that are also not present in multiplayer.


_Promod Reflex version 1.0a:
all .gsc files were modified to include reflex, as well as silencer and "none" for assault and spec ops weapon attachments options.
cac_ingame.inc changed to include options for selecting reflex/red dot sight in promod create a class.
